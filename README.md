n-Queens puzzle is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization involving the strategic placement of n queens on a chessboard without any mutual attacks. 
We investigate different algorithms covering Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, Backtracking, and Brute Force, each compared with run time, memory, and overall approach in solving the puzzle. While BFS performs expansive exploration of the solution space, it necessitates substantial memory to accommodate its breadth-wise traversal. 
In contrast, DFS pursues a deeper path, delving into the solution space with precision. Local search algorithms like Hill Climbing and Simulated annealing iteratively refine solutions towards an optimal configuration. Backtracking ensures a thorough exploration of potential solutions albeit at the cost of heightened computational demands. Lastly, the simple Brute Force approach exhaustively evaluates every possible configuration. We evaluate the strengths and limitations of each algorithm in the context of an 8-Queens puzzle.
